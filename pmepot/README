1. Run "step1_pmepot_NVT.tcl" in VMD/TckTK Console to calculate 3D Electrostatic Maps (Change the psfname, dcdname, xscname, ... accordingly).

   source step1_pmepot_NVT.tcl

   Or on Unix/Mac terminal: 
   
   vmd -dispdev text -e step1_pmepot_NVT.tcl

   The output of PMEPOT calculation is in a special data format "**.dx"
  
   !! Pay attention to the traj. size and the computer memory size. The calculation will crash if you load too many frames into VMD.
  
2. Run "step2-density-yz-place.py" to extract the Maps in the yz plane. You can modify the code to extract whatever data, along different planes/lines, you want. 
   
   modify the code after the note 
   ##### MODIFY HEREAFTER #####

   on Unix/Mac terminal: 
   python step2-density-yz-plane.py  **.dx   
   
   The output data is in "y-coord  z-coord  E" format.

   !! The PMEPOT output unit is in kcal/mol. Change it to eV by multipling (kBT/23.03), that is 0.596/23.03 for 300 K. This has been done in the code. If your simulation Temp is not 300 K, change it accordingly.
   
3. If you applied external potential/voltage, you need add this bias potential (e.g., linear interpolation of Vbias along z axis) to on the PMEPOT results.
   
   !! The PEMPOT calculated E at Zmin and Zmax are the same because of the periodic boundary condition used and are not zero, that is the offset.
      
   !! After subtracting the offset and adding the linear bias, the final data looks like: Zmin = 0 mV, Zmax = 0.5 mV
      if you applied a 0.5 mV negative potential
