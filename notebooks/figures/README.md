# Figures
This folder contains the notebooks used to generate figures in the associated publication.
Each figure is generally associated with one notebook and has a label with the subject (e.g. [Figure 5](notebooks/figures/FIG1_S4.ipynb)), although
the numbering is slightly different due to rearrangements in the manuscript.

Supplementary figures are denoted with an "S" (e.g. [Supplementary Figure 3](notebooks/figures/SuppFIG_variance.ipynb)).

An example of how to run DGA calculations from the raw molecular features (see the main `README.md` file for instructions on how
to access the requisite data).
